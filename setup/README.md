# Installation and Setup Guide

## Pre-requisites

- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Installation

To install CL-FW, go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Crane1195/CL-FW/releases) of this repository.

Under the latest one, click **Assets**, then click **Source Code (zip)**.

If you wish to change your pinout, navigate to `CL-FW/src/Hardware` on the Explorer tab, and double click the file that corresponds to your device.

- If you use a GCCMX, HTangl, B0XX, or Smash Box, the pinouts in these files match up with the controllers default pinout.
- If you are using a Model S or GCCPCB, the pinouts in these files match up with the button mapping shown in their User's Manuals.
- 255 Indicates that the button is not present on the controller

If you wish to change the button mapping for a specific game, navigate to `CL-FW/src/GameModes`.

In the constructor function, you will see a section where you can redefine which button corresponds to which of the original buttons.

See the `FGC.h` file for an example of how this is used.

---

You can configure SOCD for each Game in `src/CL-FW.ino`, which button hold corresponds to which mode in `src/Classes/Modes.h`, which coordinates each game uses in their respective files, and quite a bit more if you are willing to read through the code a bit.

---

Once you are finished configuring your firmware, press the right facing arrow on the bottom bar to upload the firmware to your controller.

## Input Viewer Setup
CL-FW is compatible with [OtaK's B0XX Viewer RS](https://github.com/OtaK/b0xx-viewer-rs). See the README there for instructions on how to set it up.

## Dolphin Setup
In the folder you copied out of the ZIP file, navigate to `setup` and copy the `CL-FW.ini` file into this Dolphin folder.
